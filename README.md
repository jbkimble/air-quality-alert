# The [Air-Quality-Alert.net](https://air-quality-alert.herokuapp.com "Air-Quality-Alert.net Homepage") Story
Air-Quality-Alert is a website where visitors can go to check the Air Quality of different locations around the world.  Visitors can also sign up to receive text or email alerts when the Air Quality in their area reaches the Good, Moderate, Unhealthy For Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, or Hazardous designations set by the EPA.

This project was inspired by the recent forest fires in the British Columbia region of Canada which caused smokey and smoggy conditions throughout the Pacific NW.  These conditions persisted for more than a week impacting both healthy individuals and sensitive groups.  It took several days of smokey and hazy conditions before the true cause, and appropriate response for these conditions, was disseminated throughout the population.  

During this time many people engaged in activities which put them at risk because a lack of awareness.  In the future Air-Quality-Alert will allow individuals, particularly sensitive populations, to be alerted as soon as conditions in their area are harmful so they can take appropriate measures to protect the health of themselves and their loved ones.
